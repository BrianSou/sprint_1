# Exercise 2.3.2: Retrieval Risks

The goal is to get correct answers from the database and policies without letting the assistant make sensitive decisions by itself.

## Main risks and controls

### Text-to-SQL

**Risk:** The assistant could write the wrong query, join the wrong tables, or expose private customer data.

**Controls:**
- Allow `SELECT` queries only, using approved tables and columns.
- Check that the user is allowed to see the requested records.
- Use parameters for IDs and limit large results.
- Check the complaint and account IDs before trusting the result.

### RAG (policy search)

**Risk:** The assistant could use an outdated policy or a section that does not apply.

**Controls:**
- Search only approved documents.
- Filter by active policy, effective date, and access permission.
- Include the policy name, version, and section in the answer.
- If the policy is missing or unclear, say so instead of guessing.

### API and other tools

**Risk:** A tool could update the wrong account, send a message twice, or issue an incorrect refund.

**Controls:**
- Only allow approved actions and check user permissions.
- Verify the exact account or complaint ID.
- Require approval before refunds, account changes, and sensitive messages.
- Check whether an action already happened before running it again.
- Keep a log of the action and its result.

### Automation

**Risk:** One mistake could affect many complaints if the same action runs automatically.

**Controls:**
- Test on a small number of cases first.
- Keep early automation read-only.
- Monitor errors and allow the process to be stopped.
- Require a person to approve bulk or high-impact changes.

## Cases I checked in the data

- **CMP001:** The review decision is `APPROVED`, but the fee is still marked as not reversed. Check whether the refund actually happened before doing anything else.
- **CMP003:** The complaint says there was a duplicate debit, but only one matching account transaction is visible. Do not approve a refund without more evidence.
- **CMP004:** A response says the online banking reset was completed, but the available audit record does not confirm the reset or identity check.
- **CMP009:** The review decision is `ESCALATED`. Do not assume every complaint marked `UNDER_REVIEW` has also been escalated.

## Basic tests

| Test | Expected result |
|---|---|
| Ask for another customer's private records without permission | Block the request |
| Generate `DELETE` or `UPDATE` SQL | Reject it |
| Search for a missing or inactive policy | Say that valid policy evidence is unavailable |
| Try to refund CMP001 a second time | Check the actual payment status and require approval |
| Claim CMP003 has a duplicate debit without a second transaction | Say there is not enough evidence |
| Calculate a business-day deadline without a holiday calendar | Do not give a definite overdue result |
| A refund or message tool times out | Check whether it completed before retrying |
